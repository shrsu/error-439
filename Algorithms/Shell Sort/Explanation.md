Got it 👍 Let’s go step by step.

# 🔹 Shell Sort Explanation

**Shell Sort** is an **in-place comparison-based, non-stable sorting algorithm** that generalizes **Insertion Sort**.
It works by allowing **exchange of elements that are far apart** first, then gradually reducing the gap until it becomes `1` (which is just Insertion Sort).

---

## 🔹 Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Choose a gap sequence** (commonly `n/2`, then `n/4`, …, down to `1`).

   * Example: For array size `n = 8`, gap sequence: `4 → 2 → 1`.

2. **Perform gapped insertion sort** for each gap:

   * Compare elements that are `gap` apart.
   * Swap if they are in the wrong order.

3. **Reduce the gap** until it reaches `1`.

4. **When gap = 1**, the array is fully sorted using **regular Insertion Sort**.

### 🔹 Example Walkthrough

Suppose we want to sort:
`[12, 34, 54, 2, 3]`

* **Initial gap = n/2 = 2**

  * Compare `(12,54)`, `(34,2)`, `(54,3)` → rearrange → `[12, 2, 54, 34, 3]`

* **Next gap = 1 (Insertion Sort)**

  * Sorted → `[2, 3, 12, 34, 54]`

# 🔹 Time Complexity

* **Best case:** `O(n log n)` (depends on gap sequence).
* **Worst case:** `O(n^2)` (with poor gap choice).
* **Average:** Between `O(n log n)` and `O(n^1.5)` for good gap sequences.

It’s **faster than Insertion Sort** for larger arrays.
